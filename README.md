# 📊 Python Correlation Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how to perform a basic correlation analysis using Python.  
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization using correlation matrices and heatmaps.

# 📁 Project Overview:
   - 📌 Load and inspect real-world data.
   - 🧹 Clean the dataset (drop unnecessary columns, handle missing values).
   - 📈 Perform correlation analysis between numerical features.
   - 🌡️ Visualize relationships using Seaborn heatmaps.

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:
   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - `pandas` – for data handling
   - `seaborn` – for plotting heatmaps
   - `matplotlib` – for basic visualizations

# 📁 Project Structure:
  - Python Correlation Portfolio Project.ipynb - Main Notebook.
  - movies.csv - Dataset Used.
  - README.md - Project Documentation.

# 📚 Learning Outcomes:
  - Learned how to identify patterns in data using correlation coefficients.
  - Practiced using .corr() in pandas for statistical analysis
  - Visualized data correlations using heatmaps for better understanding
